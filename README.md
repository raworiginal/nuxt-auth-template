# Nuxt Auth Starter

A Nuxt 4 starter project with Better Auth, NuxtHub, and PostgreSQL. It includes a local Nuxt layer for the default auth and admin experience. This repository is intended to be copied as a project template; it is not published as an npm package.

## Start a project

1. Create a project from this repository using GitHub's **Use this template** flow, or clone it.
2. Install dependencies and configure the local environment:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Set a strong `NUXT_APP_SECRET` (at least 32 characters) and choose the authentication mode in `.env` (see [Authentication mode](#authentication-mode)). `NUXT_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` can be used when you want a dedicated Better Auth secret.
4. Start PostgreSQL and prepare the database:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   In the default `email-password` mode, run `pnpm auth:setup` to apply pending migrations and create the initial admin. For `social-only` setup, follow the separate steps below.
5. Start the app:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:3000`, sign in at `/login`, and visit `/admin`.

## How the project is organized

- `layers/auth/` contains the default login, registration, admin, and profile experiences; their components, composables, account API handlers, route rules, shared schemas, and types. It is a local Nuxt layer, not a package dependency.
- `app/` contains project-owned pages and UI, including navigation and Better Auth client configuration.
- `server/` contains this project's Better Auth server configuration, app-owned API handlers and utilities, and NuxtHub-managed PostgreSQL migrations. Better Auth tables are generated from the enabled plugins.
- `/app/notes` is a small full-stack example: its PostgreSQL schema, authenticated CRUD endpoints, ownership checks, and UI demonstrate how to add private application data.

The root `nuxt.config.ts` extends `./layers/auth`. To replace a layer page or component, add a project file at the same path under `app/`; project files take priority over extended-layer files. You can also edit or remove the local layer directly in your copied project.

## Customize Better Auth

Server and client configuration live in the project so each app can add the plugins it needs. For example, to add Better Auth's username plugin, add `username()` to `server/auth.config.ts` and `usernameClient()` to `app/auth.config.ts`:

```ts
// server/auth.config.ts
import { username } from "better-auth/plugins";

// Keep the existing config and add username() to its plugins array:
plugins: [admin(), username()],
```

```ts
// app/auth.config.ts
import { usernameClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

// Keep the existing client config and add usernameClient():
plugins: [adminClient(), usernameClient()],
```

Better Auth plugin tables are generated from the server configuration. Restart Nuxt after changing plugins, generate and review a migration with `pnpm db:generate`, then apply it with `pnpm db:migrate`. Put application-owned tables in `server/db/schema/`; do not redefine Better Auth tables there.

## Configuration

The app uses PostgreSQL through NuxtHub. Set `DATABASE_URL` and `NUXT_APP_SECRET` in the environment. Set `NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the canonical production URL. Social sign-in is optional in the default email/password mode; set both variables for a provider to enable it:

```dotenv
NUXT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
NUXT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
NUXT_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
NUXT_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

Register the matching callback URLs with each OAuth provider:

- `https://your-domain/api/auth/callback/google`
- `https://your-domain/api/auth/callback/github`

### Authentication mode

`NUXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_MODE` accepts `email-password` (the default, preserving the original behavior) or `social-only`. In `social-only` mode, Better Auth disables email/password authentication on the server, the login and registration pages only offer configured OAuth providers, and at least one provider must be configured. OAuth can be used for both registration and sign-in. No email sender or email-based password reset/account recovery flow is configured in either mode.

For social-only initial admin setup, set `ADMIN_NAME` and `ADMIN_EMAIL`, configure a provider, then:

1. Run `pnpm db:migrate` to apply the schema migrations.
2. Start the app and sign in with the OAuth account whose verified email matches `ADMIN_EMAIL`.
3. Stop the app and rerun `pnpm auth:setup`. The script promotes only an existing user with a verified email and an account from a configured social provider; it does not ask for or create a password. It refuses to promote unverified or non-OAuth accounts.

`ADMIN_PASSWORD` is required only in `email-password` mode. Better Auth rate limits are stored in PostgreSQL so counters are shared across app instances; the rate-limit table is included in the generated Better Auth schema and created by the normal migration step.

The custom `/api/admin/**` endpoints are limited to 20 requests per authenticated admin per minute, and `/api/account/**` endpoints to 30 requests per authenticated user per minute. Each group shares one counter across its routes and application instances; the app uses its own PostgreSQL table and stores a hash of the user ID, not a session token. These limits do not apply to public social-provider discovery or Better Auth's `/api/auth/**` endpoints.

### Netlify or Vercel with Neon

Deploy with the standard Node/serverless runtime (Node 22.19+), not an Edge runtime. Set `DATABASE_URL` to Neon’s pooled connection string for application traffic. For migrations, set `MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL` to Neon’s direct (non-pooled) connection string; `pnpm db:migrate` and `pnpm auth:setup` prefer it when present. Both URLs must target the same database. Keep production and preview database credentials isolated.

Run migrations as a release/deploy step, not in the application build. Set `NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the production domain and configure the OAuth callback URLs above. Add secrets in the hosting provider’s environment settings rather than committing them.

### Self-hosted PostgreSQL

Use the included Docker Compose service for local development. For production, provide a PostgreSQL connection string through `DATABASE_URL` and run `pnpm db:migrate` before deploying the app.

## Database commands

```sh
pnpm db:generate  # Generate a migration from the NuxtHub/Better Auth schema
pnpm db:migrate   # Apply pending migrations
pnpm auth:setup   # Prepare Nuxt, apply migrations, and create the initial admin
```

Keep `.env` and production credentials out of source control. Use a secret manager and a managed PostgreSQL database such as Neon for hosted deployments.

## Checks

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```
